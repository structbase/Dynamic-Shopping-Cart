# 🛒 Dynamic Shopping Cart — DOM Manipulation Lab

## 📖 Overview

This project was developed as part of **Lab 5.1: Dynamic Content Creation**, focusing on practicing **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **dynamic updates** using **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap 5**.

The application simulates the shopping cart functionality of an e-commerce website. Users can dynamically:

* Add new products with names and prices.
* View and manage items in the cart.
* Increase or decrease quantities.
* Remove individual products.
* See automatic updates to subtotal, tax, and total in real-time.

This lab demonstrates the practical implementation of creating, appending, and updating elements dynamically through JavaScript.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, I was able to:

* Dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements.
* Implement event delegation for cart item management (`+`, `-`, and delete).
* Update UI content in response to user interaction.
* Maintain accurate subtotal, tax, and total price calculations.
* Ensure responsive behavior using **Bootstrap 5** and its **offcanvas sidebar** feature.
